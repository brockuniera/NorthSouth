Subunits are the bottom of the hierarchy. They're responsible for drawing
themselves, shooting/attacking and whatever else.
They should all be triggered by the Act() method of their parents because
using unity's update/fixedupdate and trying to guaruntee an order is annoying
and Act() is a more logical approach.
